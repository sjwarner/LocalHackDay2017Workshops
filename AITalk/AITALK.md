# AI Talk - Feliks

Started in a maths background, but moved to Deloitte and then in to mathematical physics. After
this moved in to symbolic computing. Was brought in to computing through engineering, but with avery different perspective.

Next, in to Machine Reasoning. Spent 7 years on campus learning about AI. Continued to move between technologies and business before settling in to AI (was CTO for a while) and writing a book (next month)!

AI and ML are very immature technologies - people are trying to put methodologies in place and it is too soon! We need to help this subject become more mature and aid during this exploratory stage.

Wrote a book on AI, but there are so many books (not all good) on AI! It means very little until you can integrate it with other technologies, when it becomes interesting.

AI can be used with other technologies including 3D printing. An example of this is an AI was trained on racing data to make a chassis - made asymmetrical chassis because data was skewed to left turn!

Distribute all of the AI! Cloud is an interesting movement and while not a silver bullet, we can make use of it and again explore this new technology!

Feliks' view on AI is that it must be multi-disciplinary. Depending on the domain, you don't need just programmers! For example, natural language program relies on language students and linguistics.

You've just got to play with it - go and explore, if something doesn't turn out well then it is still a learning experience. You can't learn programming from a book! Pick a problem and play with it. You don't have to go to a formal course, the internet is full of interesting problems and ideas.

If you partner with other people that are excited about programming, then you can get excited yourself and you'll get a lot done! However, a formal course is also good because it will teach it to you in a formal way with a framework etc.

Be careful when programming - it is a fluid discipline. You're on a bleeding edge and you have to keep up to date with all of the technologies!
